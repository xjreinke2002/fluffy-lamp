        <h1>Why I Support Emperor Edelgard</h1>
        <h2>The Logic Behind my Affiliation of the Adrestian Empire</h2>


        <h3>1. Her ideals synch with mine.</h3>
        
        <p>Emperor Edelgard seeks to recreate the nation of Fodlan so that people rise and fall by their own merits rather than either being born a filthy rich noble or forever living their lives a commoner. This is how I view our world. People are not just "naturally meant" for what they do, they worked hard to get to where they are. Though I wouldn't go so far as to wage war against the United States to make this sort of change happen, I do believe in a world where one's fate is not predetermined. If we could possibly exist in such a world, I believe it would provide far more benefits to humanity than the world we currently live in.</p>


        <h3>2. She's more than ambitious enough to garner my admiration.</h3>
        
        <p>Emperor Edelgard is far and away one of the most ambitious characters in all of <i>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</i>. She doesn't let anything stand in her way, and if anyone dares to turn against her, she is very quick to dish out punishment to them. She's a model leader, and I seek to follow her example--to obtain power and change the world, whatever it takes.</p>

        <h2>Welcome to the Strike Force</h2>
        <p>The Black Eagle Strike Force is an elite task force created and commanded by Emperor Edelgard herself. They're reserved for special tasks critical for the Adrestian Empire's development and reign. In their service, they  were critical in defeating the Leicester Alliance to the east, and the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus to the north. Upon their defeats, all of Fodlan was under the Adrestian Empire's reign.</p>
        <p>When the war had ended, they began to track down those who had orchestrated the whole war in secret. Now that the entire continent was whole, there were many more resources available. Upon the war's end, Fodlan was finally at peace throughout the nation.</p>

        <p>The Black Eagle Strike Force consisted of Emperor Edelgard von Hresvelg and Professor Byleth Eisner, the Empire's leaders; Hubert von Vestra, vassal to Edelgard who has mastered dark magic; Caspar von Bergliez, second son to Count von Bergliez who dominates with axes; Linhardt von Hevring, a laid-back noble who uses healing magic only so that he doesn't have to draw blood; Petra Macneary, a foreign warrior who has mastered the way of the blade; Dorothea Arnault, a gremory with a voice of gold; and Bernadetta von Varley, a reclusive archer who her mother sent away from her abusive father. These elite eight were the Imperial sword, leading all of the assaults that served to unify Fodlan.</p>
